Smoke Syndicator
===============

Wordpress plugin adding the capability to decide whether articles are published to the Smoke website, app, or both.

Works by registering a meta box affecting the value of a custom field, and then modifying all wordpress loops and the WP-JSON API response based on the value of this field for each post.

Also adds extra fields (category, featured image) to the API response for the app to use.

Turn this off and the app will basically break.
